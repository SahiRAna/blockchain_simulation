# Simple Blockchain Simulation in Rust

## Overview
This project simulates a simple blockchain in Rust. It demonstrates core blockchain concepts like block structure, hashing, proof-of-work, and chain validation.

## Features
- Block structure with:
  - Index
  - Timestamp
  - Transactions
  - Previous block hash
  - Current block hash
- SHA-256 hashing
- Proof-of-work mechanism
- Chain validation
- Demonstrates tampering detection

## Requirements
- Rust (install from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started))

## Setup and Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blockchain_simulation
